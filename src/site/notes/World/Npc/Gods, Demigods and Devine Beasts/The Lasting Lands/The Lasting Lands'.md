#### The Primordial Giants

In the dawn of time, before the formation of [[World/Sumara/Geography/The Triad Lands/The Sumexas Plateau\|the Sumexas Plateau]] and [[World/Sumara/Geography/The Lasting Lands\|The Lasting Lands]], the world was a chaotic expanse of untamed magic and raw elemental power. From this primordial chaos emerged the **Giants of Creation**—immense beings of earth, fire, water, and air. These giants were tasked by the Elder Gods to shape the land and bring order to the chaotic world.

#### The Giant Wars

The giants, though powerful, were not without conflict. The **Giant Wars** began when Gormund, the Earth Giant, and Ignar, the Fire Giant, disagreed over the land's formation. Gormund sought to create vast forests and fertile plains, while Ignar wished to forge mountains and volcanoes. Their battles shook the world, forming [[World/Sumara/Geography/The Triad Lands/The Sumexas Plateau\|the Sumexas Plateau]] and the Navisari Mountains. [[World/Sumara/Geography/The Triad Lands/The Sumexas Plateau\|The Sumexas Plateau]] became a place of great power, a testament to their fierce battles.

#### The Lasting Tree

During the final battle, the last surviving giants, Gormund and Ignar, realizing the destruction they caused, decided to cease their conflict. They combined their powers to create the **Lasting Tree**, a symbol of unity and peace. The tree's roots spread across the land, bringing life and stability. Its magical properties allowed it to heal the scars left by the giants' battles, leading to the creation of [[World/Sumara/Geography/The Lasting Lands\|World/Sumara/Geography/The Lasting Lands]]—a fertile and bountiful region.

#### The Guardians

The Lasting Tree was protected by ancient guardians—creatures born from the remnants of the giants' power. These guardians included the **Forest Wyrms**, serpentine beings that patrol the forest canopy, and the **Stone Sentinels**, towering beings of living rock that ensure the tree remains undisturbed. It is said that those who prove their worth can gain the guardians' favor and be granted a fragment of the giants' ancient power.

#### The Legacy of the Giants

Today, [[World/Sumara/Geography/The Lasting Lands\|World/Sumara/Geography/The Lasting Lands]] thrive as a lush and vibrant region. The people of this land revere the Lasting Tree and the guardians, honoring the giants' legacy through festivals and rituals. They believe that by maintaining balance and harmony, they continue the giants' work, ensuring that their land remains a beacon of life and prosperity.
