#### The Sun God Dahkarh

Long ago, when the world was still young, the **Sun God Dahkarh** descended from the heavens, bringing light and warmth to the barren lands. Dahkarh's touch transformed the desolate earth into the **Dahkarhy Desert**, a place of golden sands and radiant beauty. However, with his immense power, Dahkarh inadvertently created the harsh and unforgiving desert environment.

#### The Desert Spirits

To mitigate the harshness of the desert, Dahkarh created the **Desert Spirits**—ethereal beings made of sunlight and sand. These spirits roamed the desert, guiding travelers and providing them with oases and safe passages. They were seen as protectors and were worshipped by the early inhabitants of the desert, who built shrines and temples in their honor.

#### The Ice Maiden Auril

Opposing Dahkarh was **Auril**, the Ice Maiden, who ruled over the **Auril's Plains** to the north. Auril, a being of ice and snow, sought to counterbalance Dahkarh's heat by creating a land of eternal winter. Her icy breath brought snow and frost, forming the [[World/Underdark/Kingdoms/Serma\|Serma]] Mountains and the frozen plains beyond.

#### The Great Clash

Inevitably, Dahkarh and Auril clashed, their immense powers causing a cataclysmic event that shaped the lands. [[World/Sumara/Geography/SudBurn Region/The Dahkarhy Desert\|The Dahkarhy Desert]] expanded southward, while the Auril's Plains grew colder and more desolate. The clash left a scar on the land—the **Frozen Rift**—a boundary where the desert sands meet the eternal ice, a place of perpetual conflict and raw elemental power.

#### The Balance of Elements

Realizing the devastation their conflict caused, Dahkarh and Auril struck a truce. They agreed to maintain a delicate balance between their domains. Dahkarh's Desert Spirits and Auril's Frost Guardians worked together to preserve this balance, ensuring that neither the desert nor the plains would expand uncontrollably.

#### The Eternal Cycle

Today, the people of [[World/Sumara/Geography/SudBurn Region/The Dahkarhy Desert\|the Dahkarhy Desert]] and Auril's Plains honor this ancient balance through rituals and festivals. In the desert, the **Festival of the Sun** celebrates Dahkarh's light and the guidance of the Desert Spirits. In the plains, the **Festival of Frost** honors Auril's cold beauty and the protection of the Frost Guardians.

The myth of Dahkarh and Auril serves as a reminder of the importance of balance and harmony, teaching the inhabitants of Sumara to respect the forces of nature and the delicate equilibrium that sustains their world.
