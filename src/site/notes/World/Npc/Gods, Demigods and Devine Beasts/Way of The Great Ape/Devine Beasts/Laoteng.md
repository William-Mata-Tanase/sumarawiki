#### Origins and Early Life

Laoteng, the majestic Red Dragon, was born in the fiery depths of the **Keeltonas Volcano** on the island of Carahurst. His parents, formidable dragons of ancient lineage, instilled in him a profound sense of wisdom and responsibility. From a young age, Laoteng exhibited a keen intellect and an insatiable curiosity about the world beyond his volcanic home.

As he grew, Laoteng ventured from the volcano to explore the diverse landscapes of Carahurst. He observed the various beast-like races, learning their cultures, languages, and traditions. Unlike many of his kind who harbored disdain for lesser beings, Laoteng developed a deep respect for the inhabitants of the island, recognizing the strength and wisdom in their diversity.

#### Meeting the Simians

During one of his exploratory flights, Laoteng encountered a group of Simian scholars on a pilgrimage to the **Forgotten Tree**. Intrigued by their pursuit of knowledge and spiritual enlightenment, he decided to engage with them. The Simians, initially wary of the mighty dragon, soon realized that Laoteng was not an adversary but a seeker of wisdom like themselves.

Laoteng spent years learning from the Simian scholars, delving into the teachings of the Great Ape and studying the sacred texts of the **Codex Simiana**. His understanding of their spiritual and intellectual traditions deepened, and he formed a profound bond with the Simian community.
