**Name:** Jiju

**Race:** Simian

**Class:** Monk

**Background:**

Jiju was born as the second of a pair of twins in the esteemed and noble Simian family from [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Apys/Apys\|Apys]],  His elder twin, the now [[World/Npc/Regular Npc's/Kings, queens and important figures/King Jinko of Apys\|King Jinko of Apys]], was groomed from birth to inherit the family's wealth and status, leaving Jiju in the shadows. Despite being second-born, Jiju was not without his own ambitions and desires, yearning to carve out his own path in life.

Growing up, Jiju found solace in the quiet corners of the family's vast estate, often spending time in the secluded gardens and the ancestral temple. It was here that he first encountered the serene monks who visited the temple periodically. Captivated by their calm demeanor and profound wisdom, Jiju began to sneak into their meditation sessions and learn their ways in secret.

As Jiju matured, his fascination with the monastic life grew into a calling. On the day of his coming-of-age ceremony, he made a bold decision to renounce his noble privileges and devote himself to the life of a monk. His family, particularly his father, saw this as an act of rebellion, but Jiju was resolute. He left the grandeur of his family estate behind and joined a remote monastery nestled deep within the Whispering Bamboo Forest.

Under the guidance of the monks, Jiju honed his mind and body, mastering various martial arts and deepening his spiritual understanding. He learned to find balance and inner peace, qualities that would define his character. Despite the rigorous training and austere lifestyle, Jiju found a sense of fulfillment and purpose that had eluded him in his noble life.

One fateful day, during his evening meditation in the forest, Jiju encountered a small, injured black cat. Recognizing a kindred spirit in the animal, he took the cat in and nursed her back to health, naming her Tree for her agility and the way she would gracefully climb the surrounding bamboo. Tree became Jiju's constant companion, a silent observer of his training and a comforting presence during his meditations.

Years passed, and Jiju's reputation as a skilled monk and a wise sage began to spread. Despite his humble appearance, he was sought after for his counsel and revered for his discipline. However, Jiju's journey was far from over. Driven by a desire to further explore the world and understand the diverse paths of life, he decided to venture beyond the forest and offer his help to those in need.

With Tree by his side, Jiju now travels from village to village, offering his wisdom and skills to those he encounters. His noble lineage is but a distant memory, replaced by the life of a wandering monk dedicated to the pursuit of enlightenment and the betterment of all beings.
