Capital city - [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Omika/Settlements/Omikaris\|Omikaris]]
**Ancient Beginnings:**

- **Prehistoric Era:** The regions of Omika and [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/North Omika/North Omika\|North Omika]] were originally inhabited by nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes.

The Lasting Tree, believed to be a source of immense mystical power and longevity, was central to their spiritual beliefs and cultural practices.

**The Dawn of Civilization:**

These settlements grew into the early city-states of Omika and [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/North Omika/North Omika\|North Omika]]. The Lasting Tree served as a unifying symbol, fostering a sense of shared identity among the inhabitants.
- **Formation of Omika:** The city-state of Omika emerged as a prominent center of trade and culture. The fertile lands and strategic location facilitated agricultural surplus and economic growth.

**The Great Schism:**

- **Civil Strife:** About 800 years ago, internal strife and political disputes led to a significant division within the kingdom.
