### Religion of the Simians: [[World/Npc/Gods, Demigods and Devine Beasts/Way of The Great Ape/The Way of the Great Ape\|The Way of the Great Ape]]

#### Supreme Deity: The Great Ape

**The Great Ape** is the all-powerful, all-knowing deity worshipped by the Simians, a race of ultra-intelligent monkeys and apes. The Great Ape is depicted as a colossal, radiant ape, whose wisdom and intelligence surpass all understanding. The Great Ape created the world and bestowed upon the Simians their unmatched intellect, granting them dominion over their lush, verdant lands.

#### Creation Myth

According to Simian lore, the Great Ape formed the world from the cosmic jungle, weaving vines and shaping mountains with divine hands. The first Simians were created from the fertile soil, breathed to life with the essence of the Great Ape. These first beings were tasked with nurturing the world, preserving its beauty, and seeking enlightenment through knowledge and wisdom.

#### Core Beliefs and Practices

1. **Pursuit of Knowledge**: Simians believe that their purpose is to seek knowledge and understanding of the universe. Learning is considered a sacred act, and libraries and academies are often built as temples to the Great Ape.
    
2. **Harmony with Nature**: The Great Ape taught the Simians to live in harmony with the natural world. They are stewards of the forests and jungles, ensuring the balance of life and death, growth and decay.
    
3. **Meditation and Reflection**: Simians practice daily meditation to connect with the Great Ape, seeking inner peace and clarity. Reflection upon their actions and thoughts is crucial to their spiritual growth.
    

#### Monastic Tradition: The Path of the Enlightened

Some Simians, feeling a deep calling from the Great Ape, choose to renounce their lands, titles, and worldly possessions to become monks. This path is known as the Path of the Enlightened. These monks dedicate their lives to meditation, study, and the service of others. They believe that true enlightenment can only be achieved by shedding material attachments and focusing solely on spiritual and intellectual growth.

#### Heaven and Hell: The Eternal Canopy and the Abyssal Jungle

**The Eternal Canopy**: This is the Simian heaven, a realm of endless verdant forests and towering trees where the enlightened souls of the Simians dwell in eternal peace and knowledge. It is a place of infinite wisdom, where the Great Ape resides, and where souls continue to learn and grow in harmony.

**The Abyssal Jungle**: This is the Simian hell, a dark and twisted forest where souls who have strayed from the teachings of the Great Ape are trapped. It is a place of chaos and torment, where the corrupted are doomed to wander lost and isolated, cut off from the light and wisdom of the Great Ape. Redemption is possible, but it requires immense effort and the assistance of the enlightened.

#### Sacred Texts

The teachings and stories of the Great Ape are compiled in the **Codex Simiana**, a vast collection of texts encompassing mythology, philosophy, and practical wisdom. This codex is revered and studied extensively by the Simians, guiding their path to enlightenment.

Through the reverence of the Great Ape, the Simians find purpose, wisdom, and harmony, striving to embody the divine teachings in their quest for enlightenment.


### Origins and Early [[World/Sumara/History\|History]]

#### The Founding of Apys

Legend holds that the Great Ape, the supreme deity of the Simians, created the islands of the Wilds Archipelago as a haven for all intelligent and noble creatures. The Great Ape planted two sacred trees: the **Wisdom Tree** in the west, a symbol of enlightenment and knowledge, and the **Forgotten Tree** in the east, a mysterious and revered entity connected to ancient secrets and lost wisdom.

The first Simians, emerging from the fertile soil of Rotherock, were tasked with nurturing the Wisdom Tree and preserving its teachings. Over time, they established a harmonious society based on the principles of the Great Ape, fostering wisdom and intellectual growth. Meanwhile, the beast-like races on Carahurst formed their own diverse cultures, each drawing upon the unique strengths and traits bestowed upon them by their deities.

#### The Unification of Apys

The unification of Apys was a gradual process, marked by periods of conflict and cooperation. The perpetual storm of the Unpassable Strait initially isolated the different races, leading to the development of distinct cultures and societies. However, the shared reverence for the Great Ape and other deities provided a common spiritual foundation.

In the early days, the Simians of Rotherock and the beast-like races of Carahurst established tentative trade routes, sharing knowledge and resources. The Wisdom Tree and the Forgotten Tree became central to their spiritual and cultural exchanges, with pilgrimages between the two trees becoming significant events that fostered unity.

#### The Age of Exploration

With the advent of advanced navigation and resilient ships, the Simians and beast-like races began exploring the archipelago more extensively. This Age of Exploration led to the discovery of hidden islands and resources, further solidifying the bonds between the inhabitants of Apys.

During this era, a notable Simian explorer named Elder Makau led an expedition to Carahurst, forging a lasting alliance with the Leonin and Loxodon tribes. This alliance paved the way for the formal unification of Apys under a shared council, where representatives from each race gathered to make decisions for the betterment of all.

### Modern Apys

#### Governance and Society

Today, Apys is governed by the **Council of the Archipelago**, a body composed of representatives from all races lead by the King or Queen, from the Simian Royal damily. This council meets annually under the canopy of the Wisdom Tree and the Forgotten Tree, alternating between Rotherock and Carahurst. The council ensures that the diverse needs and voices of Apys’s inhabitants are heard and respected.

Simians continue to play a significant role in the spiritual and intellectual life of Apys, maintaining the great libraries and academies that serve as centers of learning for all races. The Path of the Enlightened, followed by monks like [[World/Npc/Regular Npc's/Normal people/Jiju\|Jiju]], remains a respected and influential tradition, fostering peace and wisdom throughout the land.

#### Cultural Exchange and Harmony

The diverse races of Apys have developed a rich tapestry of cultural practices, art, and traditions. Festivals and ceremonies are often shared across races, blending the unique elements of each culture into a harmonious celebration of life and nature. The annual **Festival of the Trees** is a particularly significant event, symbolizing the unity and diversity of Apys.

Trade and exploration continue to thrive, with merchants and adventurers braving the challenges of the Unpassable Strait to bring exotic goods and knowledge to and from Sumara. The perpetual storm remains a daunting obstacle, but the indomitable spirit of Apys’s inhabitants drives them to overcome its dangers.

#### Challenges and the Future

Despite its unity, Apys faces ongoing challenges. The threat of the Unpassable Strait, environmental concerns, and occasional tensions between races require constant vigilance and cooperation. The Council of the Archipelago works tirelessly to address these issues, guided by the wisdom of the Great Ape and the sacred teachings of the Wisdom and Forgotten Trees.

As Apys moves forward, it remains a beacon of harmony and diversity, a testament to the power of unity and the enduring legacy of the Great Ape. Its inhabitants continue to seek enlightenment and balance, ever striving to uphold the principles that have guided them through the ages.
