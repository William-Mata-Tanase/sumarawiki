Capital city - [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Kingdom of Astria/Settlements/Astralis\|Astralis]]

This is the home country of [[World/PC's/Edward Otto D. Astria\|Edward Otto D. Astria]]
### The Early [[World/Sumara/History\|History]]

**Origins and Unification:**

- **Ancient Tribes:** Millennia ago, the regions now known as the Kingdom of Astria and [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/South Astria/South Astria\|South Astria]] were inhabited by various independent tribes. These tribes were known for their fierce independence and diverse cultures.
- **Astrian Unification:** Around 1500 years ago, a visionary leader named Aelric the Unifier emerged from the northern tribes. Aelric managed to unite the disparate tribes through diplomacy, strategic marriages, and military might, establishing the Kingdom of Astria. This unification brought an era of relative peace and prosperity.

### The Golden Age

**Cultural and Technological Flourishing:**

- **Astrian Renaissance:** Under the rule of Aelric's successors, the Kingdom of Astria entered a golden age. The capital city, [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Kingdom of Astria/Settlements/Astralis\|Astralis]], became a center of learning, culture, and technological advancement. Scholars and artisans from across Sumara flocked to Astria, contributing to its development.
- **Expansion and Influence:** The kingdom expanded its borders through both conquest and alliances, incorporating many neighboring regions, including the fertile lands to the south. This southern region, rich in resources, became an integral part of the kingdom, contributing to its wealth and stability.

### The Great Schism

**Internal Conflicts and Division:**

- **Dynastic Struggles:** About 800 years ago, the Kingdom of Astria faced a series of dynastic struggles and succession crises. Rival factions within the royal family vied for control, leading to a prolonged period of internal conflict and civil war.
- **Southern Secession:** During this tumultuous period, the southern regions, feeling neglected and oppressed by the northern rulers, declared independence. Led by a charismatic leader named Elara of South, they formed the independent state of [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/South Astria/South Astria\|South Astria]]. The secession was marked by significant battles and skirmishes, but eventually, both sides reached a tenuous peace agreement.

### The Age of Two Kingdoms

**Separate Paths:**

- **Kingdom of Astria:** After the schism, the Kingdom of Astria focused on consolidating its remaining territories and rebuilding its strength. The northern kingdom maintained its reputation as a center of culture and innovation, continuing to attract scholars and artisans.
- **[[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/South Astria/South Astria\|South Astria]]:** [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/South Astria/South Astria\|South Astria]], under the leadership of Elara and her successors, developed its own distinct identity. The southern kingdom capitalized on its agricultural wealth and strategic location, becoming a key player in regional trade. [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/South Astria/South Astria\|South Astria]] also fostered strong military traditions to defend its independence from northern incursions.

### Reconciliation Efforts

**Attempts at Reunification:**

- **Diplomatic Overtures:** Over the centuries, there were several attempts at reconciliation and reunification. Both kingdoms recognized the potential benefits of a united front, but deep-seated mistrust and political differences often hindered progress.
- **Marriage Alliances:** Periodically, marriage alliances were arranged between the royal families of Astria and [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/South Astria/South Astria\|South Astria]] in an effort to mend relations. These alliances sometimes brought periods of peace and cooperation, though true reunification remained elusive.

### The Modern Era

**Present-Day Relations:**

- **Strategic Alliance:** In recent times, the Kingdom of Astria and [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/South Astria/South Astria\|South Astria]] have developed a strategic alliance, recognizing the mutual benefits of cooperation. Both kingdoms face common external threats and economic challenges, prompting them to work together more closely.
- **Cultural Exchange:** Cultural exchange programs have been established, allowing the citizens of both kingdoms to learn from each other and foster a sense of shared heritage. These exchanges have helped to heal old wounds and build a foundation for future unity.
- **Joint Defense Initiatives:** Recognizing the growing threats from neighboring regions and potential external invaders, Astria and [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/South Astria/South Astria\|South Astria]] have initiated joint defense initiatives. Their combined military strength serves as a deterrent to would-be aggressors.
