Capital city - [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Dahkarhia/Settlements/Dahkaris\|Dahkaris]]

**Ancient Origins and Early Interactions:**

**Early Settlements and Tribal Cultures:**

- **[[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/SudBurn Empire/SudBurn Empire\|SudBurn Empire]]:** The lands that would become the [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/SudBurn Empire/SudBurn Empire\|SudBurn Empire]] were originally inhabited by diverse tribes known for their warrior culture and reverence for fire. They believed fire was a gift from the gods, symbolizing power and transformation. Over time, the tribes unified under a powerful chieftain named Sudar, who founded the city of Burnia, giving rise to the [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/SudBurn Empire/SudBurn Empire\|SudBurn Empire]] around 2200 years ago.
- **Dahkarhia:** To the north of SudBurn, the region of Dahkarhia was settled by agrarian tribes who worshipped a pantheon of nature deities. These tribes were known for their advanced irrigation systems and agricultural techniques. Dahkar, a visionary leader, united these tribes, establishing Dahkarhia as a kingdom dedicated to the harmony between humanity and nature.
- **[[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Deva'Ni/Deva'Ni\|Deva'Ni]]:** To the east, the land of [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Deva'Ni/Deva'Ni\|Deva'Ni]] was home to a collection of nomadic clans who revered the stars and celestial bodies. These clans were guided by a spiritual leader named Deva, who claimed to interpret the will of the cosmos. The clans unified under her guidance, forming the kingdom of [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Deva'Ni/Deva'Ni\|Deva'Ni]] and establishing a capital, Niara.

**Formation of Early Alliances:**

- **Trade and Cooperation:** Early on, these three regions engaged in trade, exchanging goods like SudBurn's metalwork and weapons, Dahkarhia's agricultural produce, and [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Deva'Ni/Deva'Ni\|Deva'Ni]]'s celestial artifacts and knowledge. This trade fostered mutual respect and cooperation, with each kingdom valuing the unique contributions of the others.

**Conflict and Unification:**

**The Fire Wars:**

- **Rising Tensions:** Despite early cooperation, competition for resources and territorial expansion led to rising tensions, particularly between the [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/SudBurn Empire/SudBurn Empire\|SudBurn Empire]] and Dahkarhia. The fertile lands of Dahkarhia and the rich mineral deposits of SudBurn were highly coveted.
- **The Fire Wars:** About 1600 years ago, a series of conflicts known as the Fire Wars erupted. These wars were marked by the [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/SudBurn Empire/SudBurn Empire\|SudBurn Empire]]'s aggressive expansion and Dahkarhia's fierce resistance. [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Deva'Ni/Deva'Ni\|Deva'Ni]], initially neutral, was eventually drawn into the conflict due to its strategic location and resources.

**The Great Accord:**

- **Path to Peace:** The Fire Wars caused widespread devastation, prompting the leaders of all three regions to seek a lasting peace. The Great Accord was negotiated, establishing clear borders and promoting cooperation over conflict.
- **Marriage Alliance:** To solidify this peace, a marriage alliance was formed between the royal families of the [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/SudBurn Empire/SudBurn Empire\|SudBurn Empire]] and Dahkarhia. This alliance led to a period of relative stability and cultural exchange, further strengthening ties.

**Cultural Renaissance and Shared Prosperity:**

**The Golden Age of Harmony:**

- **Cultural Exchange:** The Great Accord ushered in a Golden Age of Harmony. The [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/SudBurn Empire/SudBurn Empire\|SudBurn Empire]], Dahkarhia, and [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Deva'Ni/Deva'Ni\|Deva'Ni]] flourished through cultural and technological exchange. Scholars, artisans, and traders traveled freely between the regions, spreading knowledge and innovation.
- **Joint Ventures:** Joint ventures, such as the construction of the Great Canal connecting the fertile lands of Dahkarhia to the bustling markets of SudBurn, exemplified this era of cooperation. [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Deva'Ni/Deva'Ni\|Deva'Ni]]'s celestial observatories became centers of learning, attracting students and astronomers from all over the region.

**Religious Syncretism:**

- **Blending of Beliefs:** During this period, religious beliefs began to blend. The fire worship of the [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/SudBurn Empire/SudBurn Empire\|SudBurn Empire]], the nature reverence of Dahkarhia, and the celestial faith of [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Deva'Ni/Deva'Ni\|Deva'Ni]] influenced each other, leading to a rich tapestry of spiritual practices. Temples and shrines dedicated to multiple deities from all three traditions were built, reflecting the interconnectedness of their societies.

**Modern Era and Continued Cooperation:**

**Formation of the Trilateral Council:**

- **Political Unity:** About 500 years ago, recognizing the need for more formal cooperation, the Trilateral Council was established. This council included representatives from the [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/SudBurn Empire/SudBurn Empire\|SudBurn Empire]], Dahkarhia, and [[World/Sumara/Kingdoms/Countries/Deva'Ni/Deva'Ni\|Deva'Ni]], working together to address regional issues, mediate disputes, and coordinate joint projects.
